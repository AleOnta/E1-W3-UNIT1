# E1-W3-UNIT1
This is the first exercise of the third week of Epicode's Full-Stack course

Today we were asked to make practice with the JS functions and also with some string methods.
We were provided with two different .js files (D6 & D6_extra) - for:
- make practice today --> with the D6.js file;
- make practice in our time off in the next days --> with the D6_extra.js file.
